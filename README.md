# Analyzing Fuel Consumption

Using R's *mtcars* data set, the main goal is to answer the following two questions. 

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG(miles per gallon)? 
2. Can we quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?

You can view the .pdf report or .Rmd for the code.
